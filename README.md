# Chess-Engine
Our aim for this project was to create a predictive chess AI that can accurately predict the best move for a given board state. However, due to time constraints and the difficult nature of this goal, we decided to use a pre-existing AI model and tweak it to work with our data. We obtained our intial dataset of about 20,000 chess games from kaggle.com, and then shortened it to 1000 games to make it work with the AI model. We then changed the repositories and code for data access and input in the AI model to train it on our data. Our final resut was a functional AI model that can predict the "best" move for a board state, but we couldn't properly figure out how to give the model a specific board state that it can predict the best move for.
